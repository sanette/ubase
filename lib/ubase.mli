(** Conversion from UTF8 latin letters to their base character.

    Use this to remove diacritics (accents, etc.) from Latin letters in UTF8
   string.

    Depends on [uutf].  It should work for all utf8 strings, regardless of
   normalization NFC, NFD, NFKD, NFKC.


    PLEASE don't use this library to store your strings without accents! On the
   contrary, store them in full UTF8 encoding, and use this library to simplify
   searching and comparison.

val from_utf8 : ?malformed:string -> ?strip:string -> string -> string
(** Remove all diacritics on Latin letters from a standard string containing
   UTF8 text. Any malformed UTF8 will be replaced by the [malformed] parameter
   (by default "?"). If the optional parameter [strip] is present, all
   non-ASCII, non-Latin unicode characters will be replaced by the [strip]
   string (which can be empty). If both [malformed] and [strip] contain only
   ASCII characters, then the result of [from_utf8_string] is guaranteed to
   contain only ASCII characters. *)

val uchar_replacement : Uchar.t -> string option
(** [uchar_replacement u] returns the replacement string for [u], representing
   its base letter without accent or diacritics, but only if [u] admits such a
   replacement.

    A number of other conversions are performed, which are not about finding the
   base letter, but an ascii equivalent of some non-ascii utf8 characters: for
   instance, single quotation marks/apostrophes (U+2018, U+2019) and double
   quotation marks (U+201c, U+201d).

    The returned string is guaranteed to be represented by a char that is
   different from [u].  *)

val uchar_to_char : ?unknown:char -> Uchar.t -> char
(** Convert a Uchar to a single char representing its base letter, without
   diacritics. For this, some simplifications have to be made. Unusual letters
   will be replaced by [unknown] (which defaults to '?').  *)

(** Convert an ISO_8859_1 string to a UTF8 string. *)

val is_space : Uchar.t -> bool
(** Return true if the character is considered as a white space (this includes
   tab and newline). *)
